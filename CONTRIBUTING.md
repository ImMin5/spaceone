# Contributing to SpaceONE

Thanks for your interest in SpaceONE. Together, we make OUR UNIVERSE a better place that changes the way to operate IT infrastructure across on-premisse and multi-clouds.

## Getting Started

SpaceONE's [open issues are here](https://github.com/orgs/spaceone-dev/projects/4). Issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors with the `good first issue` tag. An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. Issues can include bugs, new features, or documentation that looks outdated. For community support, [ask for help in SpaceONE Community Channel](https://www.spaceone.org/community/).

## Contributions

SpaceONE welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions to SpaceONE should be made in the form of GitHub pull request submissions and reviews. 

Each pull request submission will be reviewed by a committer in the project.
Only committers may merge a pull request. Large contributions should have an associated Github issue.

Pull request reviews are encouraged for anyone in the community who would like to contribute to SpaceONE, and are
expected from contributors and committers in at least equal proportion to their code contributions.
